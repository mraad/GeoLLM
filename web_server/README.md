 ### About this sample

This sample application uses the ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript ES modules (ESM), also referred to as [`@arcgis/core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arcgis/core). It uses a lightweight framework called [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/) to compile the application locally.

### Requirements

Be sure your machine has Node.js, npm and a webserver for testing of production builds. Refer to the SDK's [ES Modules guide topic](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/es-modules/#prerequisites) for more information.

### Install

To install sample and its dependencies, run `npm install`.

### Run the sample

Run the sample by using `npm run dev`. This will compile the application and launch it in a browser window.
